# Small Business Inventory Tracker

•	This model-view-controller MERN-stack application enables small business users to track inventory. I collaborated on the React frontend, implemented a backend RESTful API, and tested all endpoints with Postman. This API is called by React and reads/writes data to and from a MongoDB database. Technologies used include React, JavaScript, Express, and MongoDB. To view, logon with email david@email.com and password “test”.
