# Small Business Inventory Tracker

This model-view-controller MERN-stack application enables small business users to track inventory. I collaborated on the React frontend, implemented a backend RESTful API, and tested all endpoints with Postman. This API is called by React and reads/writes data to and from a MongoDB database. Technologies used include React, JavaScript, Express, and MongoDB.

## Design
This application was designed with a model-view-controller architecture and is responsive to whatever device is used to view it (tablet, mobile, computer). It also featurs full CRUD capability. It also features a secure login.
